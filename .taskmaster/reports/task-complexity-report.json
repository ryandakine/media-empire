			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for SABnzbd container config, qBittorrent container config, and volume mount verification.",

			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Focus on the Prowlarr service definition and the initial indexer sync configuration.",

			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into Radarr setup, Sonarr setup, API integration with Prowlarr, and download client linkage.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the inter-service communication requirements and API key management between four different services."
